# Concept
Have you ever tried to search the web for any kind of news and to notice how many different articles are found to talk about the same information?
In fact, today, because of the multiple channels of information present, it's often difficult to capture the right information. 
In the information theory the word **NOISE** indicates everything that intervenes between the transmitter and the receiver, compromising the effectiveness of the communication (it is essentially a technical interference).
In other cases, the concept assumes a metaphorical value and refers to all types of disturbances that can intervene in the communicative process, reducing its effectiveness or even compromising the result.

# The Project

### The Naming

**`Ado`** significa: rumore, fastidio, confusione, concetto predominante nel nostro progetto.
Per rendere maggiormente chiaro questo concetto abbiamo scelto degli scenari specifici, dove la comunicare e capire informazioni risulta spesso difficile.

### Our Aim
bla bla bla bla per far capire il bla bla bla

### First scenary:
The first scenary we have chosen is a **train station**, a very chaotic place where daily i's easy to take the wrong train, destination and time, because of the excess of information on the boards, and the chaos due to the crowd.

### Second scenary:
The second, and last scenary, represents the **busy city**, where the user will have to be able to take a taxi to reach his destination. Even the city, due to traffic noise and large numbers of citizens, is the perfect environment to demonstrate how difficult it is to communicate and receive information.

### Interactions:
We have chosen three different kind of interaction, coherent with our theme.

- In the first scenary there is an interaction with the **webcam** in which the user has to cover the camera of his PC, as if in reality he metaphorically to focus (narrowing the objective) the right information.
- The interaction that serves to access the second scenary, consists in **typing** a number **by the keyboard**, to simulate the real call of a taxi.
- The last interaction, finally, takes place through the **microphone**, that is: the user will have to talk to the taxi driver and bring him back to the destination. In the background, however, traffic noises and voices of citizens will be present, which will make this process more difficult and, at the same time, similar to reality.

### Credits

We used some ***p5 libreries***:
* [p5.dom.min.js](https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.dom) - To set webcam interaction
* [p5.sound.min.js](https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound) - To load sound
* [p5.speech.js](http://ability.nyu.edu/p5.js-speech/) - To make the pc able to speak and understand what you say
